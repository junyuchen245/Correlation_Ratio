# Correlation Ratio for Multi- and Mono-modal Image Registration
This repository hosts PyTorch implementation of Correlation Ratio for medical image registration, originally proposed in [this paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0056301).

We have evaluated CR has a loss function for the application of both affine and deformable registration.
